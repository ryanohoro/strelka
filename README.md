Strelka is a real-time, container-based file scanning system used for threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response. Originally based on the design established by Lockheed Martin's [Laika BOSS](https://github.com/lmco/laikaboss) and similar projects (see: [related projects](#related-projects)), Strelka's purpose is to perform file extraction and metadata collection at enterprise scale.

Strelka differs from its sibling projects in a few significant ways:
* Core codebase is Go and Python3.9+
* Server components run in containers for ease and flexibility of deployment
* OS-native client applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux
* Built using [libraries and formats](#architecture) that allow cross-platform, cross-language support

## Features
Strelka is a modular data scanning platform, allowing users or systems to submit files for the purpose of analyzing, extracting, and reporting file content and metadata. Coupled with a [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management), Strelka is able to aggregate, alert, and provide analysts with the capability to better understand their environment without having to perform direct data gathering or time-consuming file analysis.

## Quickstart

Running a file through Strelka is simple. In this section, Strelka capabilities of extraction and analysis are demonstrated for a one-off analysis.

*Please review the [documentation](https://target.github.io/strelka/) for details on how to properly build and deploy Strelka in an enterprise environment.*

#### Step 1: Install prerequisites

```bash
# Ubuntu 22.04
sudo apt install -y wget git docker docker-compose golang jq && \
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && \
newgrp docker
````

#### Step 2: Download Strelka

```bash
git clone https://github.com/target/strelka.git && \
cd strelka
```

#### Step 3: Download and install preferred yara rules (optional)

```bash
rm configs/python/backend/yara/rules.yara && \
git clone https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules.git configs/python/backend/yara/rules/ && \
echo 'include "./rules/index.yar"' > configs/python/backend/yara/rules.yara
```

#### Step 4: Build and start Strelka

```bash
docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.yaml build && \
docker-compose -f build/docker-compose.yaml up -d && \
go build github.com/target/strelka/src/go/cmd/strelka-oneshot
```

#### Step 5: Prepare a file to analyze

Use any malware sample, or other file you'd like Strelka to analyze. 

```bash
wget https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo/raw/master/malware/Binaries/Win32.Emotet/Win32.Emotet.zip -P samples/
```

#### Step 6: Analyze the file with Strelka using the dockerized oneshot

```bash
./strelka-oneshot -f samples/Win32.Emotet.zip -l - | jq
```

#### What's happening here?

1. Strelka determined that the submitted file was an encrypted ZIP (See: [taste.yara](configs/python/backend/taste/taste.yara) [backend.yaml](configs/python/backend/backend.yaml))
2. [ScanEncryptedZip](src/python/strelka/scanners/scan_encrypted_zip.py) used a dictionary to crack the ZIP file password, and extract the compressed file
3. The extracted file was sent back into the Strelka pipeline by the scanner, and Strelka determined that the extracted file was an EXE
4. [ScanPe](src/python/strelka/scanners/scan_pe.py) dissected the EXE file and added useful metadata to the output
5. [ScanYara](src/python/strelka/scanners/scan_yara.py) analyzed the EXE file, using the provided rules, and added numerous matches to the output, some indicating the file might be malicious

*The following output has been edited for brevity.*

      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### What's next?

If Strelka was deployed and ingesting files in your environment, you might be collecting these events in your SIEM. With this analysis, you could write a rule that looks for events matching the suspicious yara tags, alerting you to a potentially malicious file.

```
scan.yara.tags:("Technique_AntiDebugging" && "SubTechnique_SEH")
```

## Potential Uses
With over 50 file scanners for the most common file types (e.g., exe, docx, js, zip), Strelka provides users with the ability to gain new insights into files on their host, network, or enterprise. While Strelka *is not* a detection engine itself (although it does utilize [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/), it can provide enough metadata to identify suspicious or malicious files. Some potential uses for Strelka include:
